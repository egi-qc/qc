    Services must be monitored by the monitoring infrastructure of EGI by using 
    the public inerface of the service. The exact tests to perform for each
    service are determined by the operations community. The product should work
    with the existing probes for the service.

    TP should provide a (or a set of) monitoring probe that tests that the service
    provides the expected functionality correctly that runs integrated in the
    monitoring infrastructure of EGI.

    If the product is already being tested in the verification testbed, check that the tests
    pass OK. If the tests do not pass clarify the source of the problem (if it's a limitation
    of the verification testbed, the criterion passes as WARNING).

    If it's not being tested, contact the verifiers mailing list to configure the Nagios machine.

    If there there are no tests for the product, do also contact the verifiers mailing list to
    decide on the result of the verification.
